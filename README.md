Hi Folks,

Pony-Journal online and making my first entry.  I had a nice weekend visiting with a buddy over here from Boston.
At this very moment I am recovering from a wonderful food coma and listening to the track "Day and Age" off of the 
album "World's Fair".  Live long and prosper friends, talk soon.
